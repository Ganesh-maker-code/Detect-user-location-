The title of the project is 'Geographical Location'
In this project you'll get that user lcocation in HTML,CSS and Javascript using Geolocation API.
The Geolocation API of JavaScript is used to get the geographical position or location of a user.  Using this API, you will get the current latitude and longitude coordinates of the user if they allow it.
In this small project (Get User Location in JavaScript), on the webpage, there is a button labeled as “Detect your location”.
When you clicked on this button, there will open a location prompt with allow and block options. If you block the request then the button text will change into “You denied the request”.
If you allow the request then there will show “detecting your location”. After few seconds, there is shown your current location including city, postal code, and country.
